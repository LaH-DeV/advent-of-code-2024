# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges.

I'm tackling the problems using a variety of programming languages — just for fun and to learn new things.

## Notes

The solutions are written to the best of my understanding of the AoC challenges.

Each day's folder may contain a problem description and a brief explanation of the approach I took in a README.md file specific to that day.

### Goals and Plans

- Complete all 25 days with a variety of programming languages for fun and skill improvement.
- Explore different coding techniques and patterns in each language.
- Learn new languages and experiment with unique problem-solving approaches.

Long story short, I plan to solve the problems without spending excessive time on each one, and perhaps pick up some new skills along the way.
